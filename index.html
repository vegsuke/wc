           <h2><a><b>Water Conditioning </b></a></h2> 
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water Conditioning also known as Waste water treatment is any process that improves the quality of water to make it appropriate for a specific use.
             Which includes drinking, industrial water supply, irrigation, river flow maintenance, water recreation or many other uses, & being safely returned to the environment.
              Water Conditioning removes contaminants and undesirable components, or reduces their concentration so that the water becomes fit for its desired end-use.
             This treatment is crucial to human health and allows humans to benefit from both drinking and irrigation use.

          </p>  

          <br>
          <h2>
            <br><a><b> History </b></a></h2>

          <p>    
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient Greek and Sanskrit writings dating as far back as 2000 BC recommend methods for water treatment.
             Even then, people knew that water could be purified with heat, and they practiced sand and gravel filtration, boiling, and straining.
Their primary motivation in doing this was to make water taste better, as they couldn’t yet distinguish between water that’s clean and water that’s foul.
 They knew to try to reduce the turbidity of the water, but didn’t know much about chemical contamination or microorganisms. 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't until around 1500 BC that the Egyptians were the first to discover water purification system known as coagulation.
  Drawings exist on the tomb walls of Egyptian rulers Amenhotep II and Ramesses II showing how this water clarification system worked.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 9th century BC, Greek physician Hippocrates (also known as the father of medicine) created a device called the “Hippocrates Sleeve".
 He used a cloth bag as a strainer to pour boiled water through, eliminating foul smell.
  The Greeks and Romans both used very detailed purifying systems for water.
 These included a method of placing a bag of pounded barley and bruised coral into the water.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>
            <br><a><b> Why is Water Conditioning Important </b></a></h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Conditioning is Important because around 71% of earth's surface is water and among which only             
            1.2% is drinkable or usable, while the rest 69.8% is not suitable for drinking or any other use.
            This is because 97.2% of water is found in the oceans, which contain high level of mineral salts, 2.0% is present     
            in the form of glaciers which is mostly inaccessible to humans, 0.0001% is present in the air which collectively
            Makes 99.20001% unusable.While about 0.62% of water is found in undergrounds, 0.0009% of fresh water flows in lakes and            
            0.0001% of water is found in rivers which is only the only usable amount of water. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) report, 1.1 billion people lack access to an 
improved drinking water supply; 88% of the 4 billion annual cases of diarrheal disease are 
attributed to unsafe water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene, while 1.8 million people die 
from diarrheal disease each year. The WHO estimates that 94% of these diarrheal disease cases 
are preventable through modifications to the environment, including access to safe water. Simple 
techniques for treating water at home, such as chlorination, filters, and solar disinfection, and for 
storing it in safe containers could save a huge number of lives each year. Reducing deaths 
from waterborne diseases is a major public health goal in developing countries. That is why water 
purification is so important
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So in order to save humans from water crises we use water Conditioning, by converting unusable waste water into usable water.

              <b><em>What is Ion Exchanger?</em></b>
              <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;  An ion exchanger generally is a solid, insoluble material that contains groups which ionize in aqueous medium.

              <b>Ion Exchange Process</b><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there are many purification methods but ion exchange is well suited for highly selective removal of specific
              contaminants
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DEF:</b>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ion exchange is a water treatment process commonly used for water softening or demineralization, but it also is used to remove other substances from the water in processes such as
               De-alkalization, deionization, denitrification, and disinfection.
<br><br>
              <b>Explanation</b>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ion exchange describes a specific chemical process in which unwanted dissolved ions in water and wastewater 
              — like nitrate, fluoride, sulfate, and arsenic — are exchanged for other ions with a similar charge.
             <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ion exchange is a reversible interchange of one kind of ion present in an insoluble solid with another of like charge present in a solution surrounding the solid
              with the reaction being used especially for softening or making water demineralized,
              the purification of chemicals and separation of substances.
               
            </p>
            <p>
              
              <b>Process</b>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calcium (Ca<sup>+2</sup>) and magnesium (Mg<sup>+2</sup>) ions that cause water hardness can be removed fairly easily by using an ion exchange procedure.
              standard water softeners are cation exchange devices.
              Cations are refereed to positively charged ions dissolved in the water.
              Cation exchange involves the replacement of the ions causing hardness with non-hardness ions.
              <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water softeners usually use sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) as the exchange ion.
              Sodium ions are supplied from dissolved sodium chloride salt (NaCl), also called brine.
              in the ion exchange process, sodium ion are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener.
              <br><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hard water passes through a softener, the Calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions.
               Sodium ions are help loosely and are replaced
              easily by Calcium and magnesium ions. 
              During this process, "free" sodium ions are released into the water.
              <br><br>
              <b>Softening Process</b>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After softening a large quantity of hard water, the exchange medium becomes coated with calcium and magnesium ions.
               When this occurs, the exchange medium must be recharged or regenerated. To recharge the softener with sodium ions,
                the softener is back-flushed with a salt brine solution.
              During a back-flush, the brine solution replaces calcium and magnesium ions on the exchange medium with sodium ions from the salt solution.

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zeolite method is the process of softening hard water via ion exchange technique using chemical
                compound zeolite.
<br><br>
<b>Zeolite Compound</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a chemical compound that has hydrated sodium aluminosilicate.
              Zeolite can exchange its sodium cations reversibly with calcium and magnesium ions in the water softening process.

                <p>
                  <br>
                  <b>Process</b>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the water softening process, we pass the hard water through a bed of zeolite (inside a cylinder) at a specified rate.
                  Then the cations that cause the water-hardening will retain on the zeolite bed because these cations (Mg<sup>+2</sup> and Ca<sup>+2</sup>) exchanges with the zeolite cation (Na<sup>+1</sup>).
                  Therefore, the water coming out of this cylinder contains sodium cations rather than calcium and magnesium cations.
                  After some time, the zeolite bed gets exhausted.
                  Then we have to stop the water flow and treat the bed with concentrated brine solution (10%) in order to regenerate the zeolite.
                  When we treat the bed with a brine solution, it washes away all the calcium and magnesium ions, by exchanging them with sodium ions in a brine solution.
                  Therefore, this treatment regenerates the zeolite.
<br><br>
                  <b>Difference Between Ions Exchange Method & Zeolite Method</b>
                  <br>Ions exchange method and zeolite method both are used for water softening. 
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main difference between both methods is that, ion exchange method is used to remove Mg<sup>+2</sup> and Ca<sup>+2</sup>
                  cations by using different anions or cations in exchangers.
                  While Zeolite is similar to ion exchange method but the difference is that zeolite method uses the mineral zeolite
                  as exchanging resin for cation in water, e.g Natrolite (hydrated aluminum silicate), Na.2Al.2SiO<sub>10</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O (Zeolite)

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic ion exchangers are three-dimensional covalent networks that contain exchangeable ions associated with fixed acid or basic groups.
                          The term ‘ion exchange resins is also used to describe organic ion exchangers.
                         The ion exchangers that have fixed acid groups and carry exchangeable cations (usually H<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ) are cation exchangers described as <b>H</b> and <b>Na</b> , respectively.
                          Those with fixed base groups and exchangeable anions (OH<sup>-</sup> or  Cl<sup>-</sup>) are anion exchangers in the <b>OH</b> form and <b>Cl</b> form, respectively.
                          In the accepted terminology, the three-dimensional network with the fixed groups is called the <b>matrix or framework</b> and exchangeable
                          ions of opposite sign, which neutralize the fixed ionic groups, are the counter-ions that are responsible
                          for the ion exchange process.

                    <b><li><b><a>Lime Soda Process</a></b></li></b>
                    <b>Introduction</b>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lime soda process is a method of softening hard water. 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is now obsolete but was a very useful method for the treatment of large volumes of hard water.
                    In this process Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) ions are precipitated by the addition of line (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) and 
                    soda ash (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Process</b><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method uses Lime (ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) and Soda ash (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) to reduce the hardness of the treated
                    water by precipitation the dissolved calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) salts as insoluble calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide
                    respectively.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This process is also used in the preparation of caustic soda (NaOH), by mixing slaked Lime (ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) with soda and filtering off the
                    precipitated calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Slacked Lime is added to water, it will react with any carbon dioxide present
                    <br>
                    Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> ------- CaCO<sub>3</sub>(pp) + H<sub>2</sub>O 
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Lime will react with carbonate as <br>
                    Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> -------- MgCO<sub>3</sub> + CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The product magnesium carbonate is soluble and to remove it more lime added
                    Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + MgCO<sub>3</sub>  -------- CaCO<sub>3</sub> + Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Also Magnesium non-carbonate , such as magnesium sulfate, is removed
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + MgSO<sub>4</sub> ------- +CaSO<sub>4</sub> + Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lime addition removes only magnesium hardness and calcium carbonate hardness.
                    As we saw some of the magnesium is precipitated so for that an equivalent amount of calcium is added.
                    The water now contains original calcium non-carbonate hardness and some calcium non-carbonate hardness produced.
                    So for that Soda ash is used to remove the calcium non-carbonate hardness 
                    <br>

                    Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + CaSO<sub>4</sub> --------  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + CaCO<sub>3</sub>
                    <br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To precipitate CaCO<sub>3</sub> requires a pH of about 9.5 and to precipitate Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> requires a pH of about 10.8 
                   <br>
                   
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-carbonation (Adding more carbon dioxide) is used  to stabilize the water by stabilizing excess lime and magnesium hydroxide, which also reduces pH from 10.8 to 9.5.
                   and further re-carbonation will bring pH to about 8.5 and stabilize the calcium carbonate 
                   <br>
                   However, it is imported to note that is not possible to remove all hardness from water.

                     
                    Lime Soda Process is  carried out in two ways:

              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water treatment (Conditioning) is achieved in 3 main steps, which are as followed
                <ul>
                  <li>Preliminary Water treatment</li>
                  <li>Primary water treatment</li>
                  <li>Secondary water treatment</li>
                  <li>Tertiary water treatment</li>
                </ul>
<br> <br>

                <ol>
                  <li><b><a>Preliminary Water Treatment</a></b></li>
                  <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first basic process is the preliminary treatment.
                     During this process, water is pumped in from the sewer system into the treatment works.
                      The water is pumped along concrete channels into the inlet screen.
                      The inlet screen is a large screen with holes that are 5mm in diameter.
                      It removes larger solids that cannot pass through these holes.
                      The solid that is removed is labeled as “rag.” The wastewater and rag are pumped into the liceps.
                       The liceps are large spinning dryers that dry the rag.
                      The rag is then taken to a dump.
                      The wastewater continues on to the grit removal channels.
                      In these channels, solid particles that are smaller than 5mm thick sink to the bottom of the tank.
                      Every 2 weeks, this layer of material is washed out so the channels will not get blocked.
<br><br>

                   <li><b><a>Primary Water Treatment</a></b></li>
                   <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the water is ready to be pumped into the primary tanks.
                    Where the wastewater stays for long enough to allow the organic waste to sink into the bottom of the tank,
                    which usually takes 5 to 6 hrs.
                    After waiting  material that are either floating or has been readily settled out by gravity, are removed.
                    <br> <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It includes the physical processes of screening, comminution (the action of reducing a material, especially a mineral ore, to minute particles or fragments), grit removal, and 
                    sedimentation (Sedimentation is the process of allowing particles in suspension in water to settle out of the suspension under the effect of gravity).
                    Primary wastewater treatment, in general, removes about 60% of suspended solids from wastewater.

                   <ul>
                     <li><b>Sludge Treatment</b></li>
  
                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scrapers scrape this organic waste, or “sludge,” from the bottom of the tanks. 
      This sludge is then pumped to the digesters for treatment. 
      The primary digester receives the sludge from the primary tanks. 
      Here, anaerobic bacteria, bacteria that live without air, eat and break down the sludge. 
      The sludge sits in the primary digester for about 2 weeks. After that time, it is heated to 36°C. 
      This process removes any offensive smell. 
      An interesting thing happens from the sludge digestion. 
      Methane gas is made. 
      This same methane gas is used to heat the primary digester. 
      A secondary digester is also used. 
      Here, more of the organic solids are eaten. 
      Afterwards, the sludge is taken to a press building. 
      Sludge is taken to this building to be pressed of all moisture. 
      This results in a black, caked material. 
      This material can then be used as agricultural fertilizer.

                            <p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary wastewater treatment uses biological and chemical means for the substantial (concerning the essentials of something) elimination of dissolved organics and colloidal materials. 
                              <br>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The processes used in the secondary treatment are 
                              Activated sludge, Aerated Pond, Aerobic-anaerobic ponds, Trickling filter, Chemical oxidation, Chemical mixing flocculation and clarification, Gravity filtration, Dissolved-air flotation with chemicals, Pressure filtration, Anaerobic contact, etc. 
                              Secondary wastewater treatment is capable of removing more than 90 percent of suspended solids.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The biological treatment lanes are the next destination for the wastewater after leaving the primary tanks.
                                  Most water facilities have about six of these lanes.
                                  These lanes have diffusers.
                                  Air is pumped into these lanes allowing the bacteria to live in the wastewater and eat most of the organic material present (usually fats and colloids).
                                  Each lane consists of three zones. 
                                  Zone 1 has the most organic materials. 
                                  So, more air is pumped into this zone allowing the bacteria to eat the organic materials in this zone. 
                                  After the water leaves the lanes, some of it goes to a holding area so it can be used for future treatments.

                              removing inorganic compounds (phosphates and nitrates), bacteria, viruses, and parasites.
                               Removing these harmful substances makes the treated water safe to reuse, recycle,
                                or release into the environment.

<br><br>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following are some main concepts related to this topic
</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hard Water</li>
              <li>Soft Water</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
              
              <li><b>Hard Water</b></li>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hard water is water with excess calcium and magnesium, while soft water is free from these 
harsh minerals that can damage your home and body. It is gentle, with calcium and magnesium 
removed through water softener system

<br>
<br>
  <b>Softness of water can:
  </b>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Prevent scale buildup around your home:</b></li>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With hard water minerals removed at the point of entry to your home, your pipes 
and appliances will have a longer lifespan. Sediment particles will be removed before they ever 
come into contact with your dishwasher or water heater, keeping them free from buildup as 
well as working better for longer.

  </p>

  <li><b>Increase the effectiveness of soap:
  </b></li>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Minerals in hard water actually decrease soap’s effectiveness, according to the University of 
Nebraska, requiring more soap or shampoo to make a lather. That’s why it’s difficult to work up 
good suds in the shower or when washing your hands, and why you may be buying soap or 
detergents more frequently. A water softener system will ensure your soap is doing its job 
while simultaneously reducing the stains and the need for additional cleaning.
  </p>

  <li><b>Combat dryness:</b></li>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When the weather turns colder or when there is generally less humidity, soft water can help 
    reduce dry, uncomfortable skin conditions. Given that soap is more effective with soft water, 
    shampoo and body wash can do its job to make your hair and skin softer and silkier with every 
    wash – you don’t have to deal with the buildup hard water leaves behind.
  </p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hard water is water that has high mineral content (in contrast with "soft water"). Hard water is 
formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone, chalk or gypsum which are 
largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates, bicarbonates and sulfates.
Hard drinking water may have moderate health benefits. It can pose critical problems in 
industrial settings, where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns 
in boilers, cooling towers, and other equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard
water is often indicated by a lack of foam formation when soap is agitated in water, and by the 
formation of limescale in kettles and water heaters. Wherever water hardness is a 
concern, water softening is commonly used to reduce hard water's adverse effects.

                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When hard water comes into contact with your body, it can strip naturally occurring oils and 
coat your skin and hair with mineral buildup. You may not feel cleaner, even after scrubbing 
with shampoo and soap. Hair can become stiff and limp, even falling out more easily. Skin 
conditions can worsen when in direct and continued contact with the minerals in hard water.

                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As hard water lands on surfaces, collects on showerheads and doors, and dries on dishes, the 
evaporating water leaves behind scaly-looking sediment build-up. You may see it on your 
washed silverware and plates that have a white film or spots. There may be streaks left behind 
wherever water comes into contact. The residue left by hard water isn’t just unsightly; it also 
can lead to extra time and money spent cleaning.

                <li><b>Damage pipes and appliances:
                </b></li>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sediment buildup can make for costly and time-consuming repairs. When hard water comes 
into contact with pipes and appliances, the minerals can clog, causing the breakdown of the 
pipes and valves. Your refrigerator, laundry machine and other water-dependent appliances 
may have a shorter life thanks to hard water. Minerals in hard water are harsh, and miniscule 
sediment can build into a much greater problem for you and your home
